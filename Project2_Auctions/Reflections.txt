1. Things that could have been better
    1.1 - The information of bid is both on the Listing/auction and on the Bid models. Having this information only on relational base of Bid would be nice,
    but it is necessary to find a way to implement this without too much computation when showing current prices and current bidder. Having the information
    on both tables seemed like a good ideia. Thinking would be necessary to find a better way to do this if possible.

    1.2 - Both index, watchlist and categories view share the same structure, but have been made with copy and pasta both of html and functions.
    It should have been better designed, in such a way that code was reused on all these similar pages, in order to make altering and maintaining code easier.

    1.3 - Loading the watchlist and current_bids list was repeated on several functions. It could have been generalized to another function.

2. Things that would be nice to have
    2.1 - Since categories were built as having parents:
        -> Create some way to show all items on subcategories on the category view.
        -> Show category on a tag on the index view, and on categories view, show subcategory as a tag also, if applicable.
    2.2 - Implement a way to cancel an auction.
    2.3 - Implement a bids view that allows the auctioneer to see history of bids on his auction.
    2.4 - It would be nice to display that an auction has been closed or canceled on its page. Currently only the winner sees a message informing that he won.
